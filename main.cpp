Project 3 - Part 1b / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Continue your work on branch Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to 
reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write UDTs

You are going to write 10 UDTs in project3.  
Part1 will be broken up into 5 separate steps
    Part 1a: you will learn to think about an object in terms of its sub-objects.
    Part 1b: you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english
    Part 1c: you will write 1 UDT in plain english that will be made of 5 related sub-objects
    Part 1d: you will write plain-english UDTs for the 5 sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c
    Part 1e: you will convert those 10 plain-english UDTs into code that runs.
************************

1)  Fill in #1 - 4 with a random UDT in plain english
    These 4 UDTs do not need to be related.
        a) For each plain-english UDT, write out 5 traits or properties and 3 things it can do
        b) remember: these properties will eventually become primitives

 example:  
 
Thing: Car Wash   
    5 properties:
        - number of vacuum cleaners
        - number of eco-friendly cleaning supplies
        - stores the amount of water used per week.
        - stores amount of profit made per week
        - number of cars serviced per day
    3 things it can do:
        - wash and wax car
        - charge customer
        - detail the car interior

    Notice that I did not use "has a vacuum cleaner" or "Has eco-friendly cleaning supplies" as one of the properties
    
    Writing 'has a ___" checks whether or not your object **has the ability to do something**.
    Instead, I wrote "number of vacuum cleaners" and "number of eco-friendly cleaning supplies".  
    
    These are specific objects or amounts. 
    
    In C++ terms, this means to I want you to avoid using 'bool' (has a) as a member variable type.
    Instead, prefer the other primitive types.

Thing 1) Crane
5 properties:
    1) cabin for the operator to sit at the top of the machine
    2) ladder to climb up to the cabin
    3) horizontal arm to move the trolley
    4) Counterweight to balance the arm 
    5) Trolley to place the package in the z-axis 
3 things it can do:
    1) pick up a package and move it vertically in the air
    2) move the package horizontally in the air
    3) move the horizontal arm veritcally along the tower
 */

/*
Thing 2) Elevator
5 properties:
    1) numbers of buttons according to each floor
    2) alarm button if escalator get stuck between floors
    3) cable system to hold humans while moving vertically
    4) recorded voice messages to indicate which floor we are currently in when the doors open
    5) dispaly digital screen
3 things it can do:
    1) Move the car vertically
    2) Open/Close the car doors after moving the car vertically
    3) indicate which level we are in after the car stopped moving.

/*
Thing 3) Fishing boat
5 properties:
    1) stores fish captured every day
